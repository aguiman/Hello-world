Hello-world
===========

I'm a molecular biologist with ZERO background in programming, but highly interested in changing that. Any help or friends interested in collaborations are more than wellcome!

My main goal is to generate ideas that will help us to analyse lots of data that is currently available (online) from several bioinformatics institutes around the world. That analysis will be focused in addressing scientific questions about basic biology that might be helping in the development of new treatments. For example: gene expression patterns and a particular health condition (such as cancer).

Any human been is wellcome to contribute.

Thanks and see you arround !

Aguiman
